# Broadcast Technology 
I have experience in Broadcast Technologies ranging from analog setups, to digital workflows, to IP based video routing and delivery. I'm knowledgeable about switching, camera blocking and  character generation with a deep understanding of video encoding and compression.
# Web Development
I'm a seasoned Front-End Developer and experienced with some full stack projects ranging from a traditional LAMP stack to nodeJS based deployments.
# Server Administration
I run my own mailserver - send an email to me (at) jasonchua.net. I have a higher APM on a Linux command line than I do in Starcraft.
