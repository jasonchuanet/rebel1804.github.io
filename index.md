# A Passion for News
To truly understand the needs of a modern newsroom, I started one. [Layers Media](https://layers.media) is a digital student newspaper employing proven web technologies to provide otherwise untold student news. I also wrote for the local newspaper, [LkldNow](https://www.lkldnow.com/author/jasonchua), as a news intern. I'm currently studying Journalism as a masterâ€™s student at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communications and Journalism in Los Angeles.
# Web Development
I'm a seasoned Front-End Developer and experienced with some full stack projects ranging from a traditional LAMP stack to nodeJS based deployments.
# Broadcast (Technology)
I have experience in Broadcast Technologies ranging from analog setups, to digital workflows, to IP based video routing and delivery. I'm knowledgeable about switching, camera blocking and  character generation with a deep understanding of video encoding and compression.
