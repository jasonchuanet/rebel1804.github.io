# A Passion for News
To truly understand the needs of a modern newsroom, I started one. [Layers Media](https://layers.media) is a digital student newspaper employing proven web technologies to provide otherwise untold student news that I started while earning my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at Florida Polytechnic. During that, also wrote for the local newspaper, [LkldNow](https://www.lkldnow.com/author/jasonchua), as a news intern. 

I earned my Masters of Science in Journalism at University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communications and Journalism in Los Angeles.

Currently, I'm broadcast engineer for KGW-TV in Portland OR. Here, I manage infrastructure and provide support to the newsroom.
