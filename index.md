# A Passion for News
To truly understand the needs of a modern newsroom, I started one. [Layers Media](https://layers.media) is a digital student newspaper employing proven web technologies to provide otherwise untold student news.
# Web Development
I'm a seasoned Front-End Developer and experienced with some full stack projects ranging from a traditional LAMP stack to nodeJS based deployments.
# Broadcast Technology 
I have experience in Broadcast Technologies ranging from analog setups, to digital workflows, to IP based video routing and delivery. I'm knowledgeable about switching, camera blocking and  character generation with a deep understanding of video encoding and compression.
# Server Administration
I run my own mailserver - shoot me an email to website (at) jasonchua.net.
